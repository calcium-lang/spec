# Curium
A C-like memory- and thread-safe systems programming language with zero-cost object-orientation.
Its name is a tribute to Marie and Pierre Curie, whom the chemical element Curium(Cm) was named after.
It is heavily inspired on C, and tries to support all its features. It is also inspired on Java, and implements a subset of its object-orientation model, while trying to remove the space- and time-costs of such abstractions. Some of its syntax is inspired on Python.
