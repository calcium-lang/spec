# Cesium
A C-like memory- and thread-safe systems programming language with near-zero-cost object-orientation.

Its name is after the chemical element Cesium(Cs).

It is heavily inspired by C, and tries to support all its features. It is also inspired by Java, and implements a subset of its object-orientation model, while trying to remove the space- and time-costs of such abstractions. Some of its syntax is inspired by Kotlin, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust.
