Static Pointer
- Can point to a local variable/constant (or its subparts that are accessible by the current method) that exists at least in the same scope of the pointer.
- Can point to an argument (or its subparts that are accessible by the current method).
- Can point to a non-static field of the current struct object (or its subparts) that is accessible by the current method.
- Can point to a static field of any struct (or its subparts) that is accessible by the current method.
- Can point to an object borrowed from a dynamic pointer that is owned by the current method and that exists at least in the same scope of the pointer.
- Can point to everything above (including this) present in the call scope of the caller method.
- Can be stored in a local variable/constant (or its subparts that are accessible by the current method).
- Can be stored in an argument (or its subparts that are accessible by the caller method) only if the argument does not demand a pointer to a static field, or if the pointer points to a static field; and if the argument does not demand a pointer to an extern object (an object that is not a local variable/constant, an argument or an object borrowed from a dynamic pointer that is owned by the caller method), or if the pointer points to an extern object.
- Can be stored in a non-static field of the current struct object (or its subparts) that is accessible by the current method only if it does not point to a local variable/constant (or its subparts) or an argument (or its subparts) of the current method, it is not stored in an argument, or the argument is extern.
- Can be stored in a static field of any struct (or its subparts) that is accessible by the current method only if it points to a static field of some struct (or its subparts).

Dynamic Pointer
- The method that stores it owns it
- It can't be stored in an array or struct
- Regular methods should never finish owning a dynamic pointer
- Can be obtained from method argument
- Can be obtained from method call return
- Can be obtained from pointer copy
- Can be transferred by method call argument
- Can be transferred by method return
- Can be transferred by pointer copy
- Can be borrowed by implicit cast to static pointer
- The borrowings are revoked when the dynamic pointer is transferred to another method
